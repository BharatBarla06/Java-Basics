MAP INTERFACE COMPONENTS NOTES

Map: The main interface representing a collection of key-value pairs. It does not allow duplicate keys.

Map
├── HashMap
├── LinkedHashMap
├── TreeMap
├── Hashtable


Explanation of components:

1. HashMap: Implements the Map interface using a hash table. It does not guarantee the order of key-value pairs and allows null keys and values.

2. LinkedHashMap: Extends HashMap and maintains the insertion order of key-value pairs. It uses a doubly-linked list to maintain the order.

3. TreeMap: Implements the Map interface using a Red-Black tree. It orders the key-value pairs based on the natural ordering of keys or using a comparator provided at the time of creation.

4. Hashtable: A legacy class that implements the Map interface using a hash table. It is synchronized and does not allow null keys or values.

Set
├── HashSet
├── LinkedHashSet
└── TreeSet

Explanation of components:

1.HashSet: Implements the Set interface using a hash table. It does not guarantee the order of elements and allows null elements.

2.LinkedHashSet: Extends HashSet and maintains the insertion order of elements. It uses a doubly-linked list to maintain the order.

3.TreeSet: Implements the Set interface using a red-black tree. It orders the elements based on their natural ordering or using a comparator provided at the time of creation.

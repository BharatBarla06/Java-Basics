1.Synchronization:
-Vector is synchronized (thread-safe).
-ArrayList is not synchronized (not thread-safe).

2.Performance:
-Vector is slower due to synchronization.

3.Growth Factor:
-Vector doubles its size when resizing.
-ArrayList increases its size by 50% when resizing.\

4.Legacy:
-Vector is a legacy class.
-ArrayList is part of the Collections framework.

5.Iterator Fail-Fast:
-Both have fail-fast iterators.
